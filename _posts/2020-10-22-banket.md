* 315 g flour (2 cups)
* 1 cup cold butter
* 0.5 to 1.0 cup cold water

Cut butter into flour.  Add half cup of water, then add up to another
half cup, until dough barely holds together.  Roll out dough, fold,
and turn.  Repeat 3 times, refrigerating between turns to keep dough
cold.  When done, let rest in fridge for ~30 minutes.

* 320 g almond flour (2 cups)
* 340 g powdered sugar (3 cups)
* 90 g flour (1/2 cup)
* 0.5 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoon almond extract
* 2 eggs (120 g)

Mix dry ingredients, then add wet ingredients.  Result should be a
thick paste.

* 1 egg white
* 3 tablespoons sugar

Divide pastry in four, then roll out until thin.  Wrap pastry around
filling, and arrange on cookie sheets.  Beat egg white, then brush on
top.  Sprinkle sugar overtop.

Bake at 450 degrees for 15-20 minutes, until golden.  Let cool before
even thinking about cutting into slices.  Good day-of, even better
after drying for 2-3 days.  Later results unavailable, samples eaten.
