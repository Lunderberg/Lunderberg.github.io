Even the most avid follower will not refresh a page minute by minute,
  weeks after the most recent post.
It would require patience and insanity
A better solution is to use Atom or RSS feeds,
  which notify a user when there is an update.

With jekyll, the Atom and RSS feeds can be automatically created,
  to be updated whenever there is a new post.
The `hyde` theme comes with an Atom feed template,
  and an RSS feed template is available under the MIT license
  from http://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds .
These have been added to the site, and are now available from the sidebar.

Feed readers exist to accumulate and deliver new posts from any website that includes feeds.
I use [Feedly](http://feedly.com), a browser-based feed reader.
