My name is Eric Lunderberg.  I have a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from
Michigan State University, with a strong background in computer
programming and mathematics.  This blog started with discussions of
C++ and build systems on Linux, and has expanded to include things
that I commonly look up, such as recipes.
